                        <p>At Nilocollab, I worked in a larger codebase and with a larger development team, with around 10 other developers at most, each working on different branches for various tasks.
                            During my time at Nilocollab, I was introduced to JIRA, and it became an integral part of my workflow. Additionally, I had my first experience using MUI.
                            I was assigned both smaller and larger tasks. One significant task involved collaborating with another intern to develop a Dashboard based on their Figma mockup. </p>
                        <p>Another significant achievement during my time at Nilocollab was reorganizing a file, it went from around 1500 rows to 500 rows after I was done.</p>

                        <p>At Lindcode, I flourished the most. I received a lot of responsibility and worked independently most of
                            the time, but also engaged in some pair programming. </p><p> During my time at Lindcode, I worked agile,
                                participating in daily standups and planning sessions. From Figma to code, I collaborated with another intern to build the architecture for a
                                digital course platform, developing both the backend and frontend. In the backend, we used MongoDB, Express, and Node.js.
                                For the frontend, we utilized React.js and SASS. The tools we used included Figma and Trello.</p>

                            During my time as a sales assistant at Dressmann, I gained valuable experience in customer relationship management.
                            My number one job was to make the customers feel welcome and wanted. Other daily tasks included accepting
                            deliveries, unpacking and organizing the clothes, and ensuring they were displayed appropriately.
                            I also managed store opening and closing procedures and had full responsibility for the cash register.
                            Additionally, I was given some creative design tasks, such as choosing outfits for the mannequins and
                            arranging shelf placements.

                            The tasks were varied, and I would typically follow a cycle, completing all of them during a workday.
                            These tasks included handling customer payments. Additionally, I inspected the quality of the clothes being sent in,
                            priced objects, and maintained the store's cleanliness and tidiness.
